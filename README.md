# Multi-Tenant Order Management API

## Project Goals
- Provide a multi-tenant backend API for businesses
- Enable role-based user management (Admin, Staff)
- Support product and order creation
- Generate Stripe payment links securely
- Enforce strict tenant isolation and authorization

## Non-Goals
- No customer-facing frontend (API-only project)
- No inventory management or forecasting
- No refunds or Stripe webhook handling
- No analytics or reporting dashboards

## Architecture
